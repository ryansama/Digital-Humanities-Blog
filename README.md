# Digital Humanities Logs

Digital humanities is an area of research and teaching at the intersection of computing and the disciplines of the humanities. This webpage of logs was made to showcase my learning in the field, as part of a course at my university. View the website **[here](http://www.web.uvic.ca/~ryansama/DHUM150-logs/)**. The website will be updated as the course progresses.
