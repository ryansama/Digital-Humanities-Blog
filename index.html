                    As a conclusion to DHUM 150, each of us created small projects which reflect upon our learning in the course. Our task was to build an interactive application or animation that would be relevant to other contexts, such as other courses. As my final project, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to build a web application called the Matrix Multiplier. Access it <a href="http://www.web.uvic.ca/~ryansama/matrix-multiplier/" target="_blank">here</a>. It is a tool created for students who are taking mathematics courses in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra" target="_blank">linear algebra</a> (a.k.a. matrix algebra). Its function is to accept two matrices of up to size <var>9 x 9</var> from the user and to output the product of these matrices. In the development process, I benefited from documentation and sample code in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p class="log-content-para">
                    This project is strongly connected to DHUM 150 for several reasons. Firstly, our work with <b>HTML, CSS, and FTP</b> is fully apparent, as the Matrix Multiplier is a web application that is hosted on a remote server. The purpose of the Matrix Multiplier is <b>automation</b>, which was emphasized in our discussion of new media; multiplying matrices is a tedious task that can now be assigned to a computer. Although I developed this appliction independently, I have uploaded the source code onto a <a href="https://github.com/ryansama/matrix-multiplier" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. Here, other members of the GitHub community can contribute towards the development of the Matrix Multiplier. In other words, it is open for yet another concept of DHUM 150: <b>crowdsourcing</b>.
                  </p>
                  <p class="log-content-para">
                    Although it may seem complete at first, the Matrix Multiplier has several flaws. If I had more time to spare, I would improve upon the application. First of all, it does not accept fractions as input. In order to accept them, the JavaScript must evaluate each input before entering the multiplication step. Secondly, the Matrix Multiplier should include error handling for invalid input. For example, the application does not provide any error messages when non-numerical values are entered. Again, the JavaScript code must be modified for this to occur. Additionally, I would improve usability of the application by allowing the user to freely enter dimensions for the input matrices, as they are currently limited to <var>9 x 9</var> matrices. Lastly, I would use a framework such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> to add responsiveness to the application.

                      While creating this audio file was an exercise in audio manipulation, it also broadened our understanding of fair dealing in Canada. When reading about fair dealing, I discovered that considering <a href="http://www.uvic.ca/copyright/policies/copying_guidelines/index.php" target="_blank">fair dealing copying guidelines</a> is particularly important with regards to the production of audio that is composed of  copyright-protected sound. This is significant to me in that analyzing a produced work with respect to these guideleines are especially relevant in the academic setting. The restriction can be summarized: a student may communicate and reproduce, in paper or electronic format, <b>short excerpts</b> from a copyright-protected work. Short excerpts, in the context of audio production, is defined as less than 10% of the original sound recording. Of course, the student must provide respective sources, including authors and creators.
                    </p>

                    <p class="log-content-para">
                      The circulation of new media is heavily affected by this guideline as well as other restrictions in the Copyright Act. The fair dealing copyright guideline, if followed, allows authors and creators to be exposed by academic usage of their works. Audio and music producers gain recognition with circulation of their work. In most cases, this is a beneficial outcome for both the scholar and content creator.

                      Licensing is a common method of restricting reproduction of a work.

                      The command line, also known as the "shell, "command prompt," or "terminal," is an interface that allows the user to perform various tasks in a computer without a graphical user interface(GUI). Moreover, the command line allows for directory (folder) exploration, program execution, and modification/analysis of plain text files without the use of a mouse. It is commonly used in text analysis and used rigorously in computer programming. Command line tasks are always performed by entering various commands and arguments. For exmaple, the commands <code>cd</code> (<em>change directory</em>), <code>pwd</code>(<em>print working directory</em>) and <code>ls</code> (<em>list</em> files) are used to view files and switch between directories in Unix-based shells.
                    </p>
                    <p class="log-content-para">
                      Similarly, the <code>grep</code> command is often used when reading text files. Its main function is to search for lines containing a piece of text. The user can further customize their search by passing arguments such as <code>-n</code> (show line <em>numbers</em>) and <code>-c</code> (show line <em>count</em>). Even more specific searches can be made using regular expressions, which are strings of text that describe a search pattern. Regular expressions use symbols that can search for multiple instances of letters and numbers. These are often used in computer programs and websites to verify user input. For example, the expression <code>''\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}\b'</code> is used to verify whether an email address is in a correct format.

                      Reading, analyzing, and interpreting text are common tasks in the humanities. Today we have millions of literary works and books available for research, but performing close reading (reading every detail of a text repeatedly) on many of these works is tedious and time consuming. Distant reading is an alternative to this task.

                      The motivation behind distant reading is to scan text and visualize its main ideas, word frequencies and trends. It is advantageous for scholars and researchers because it is much less time consuming than close reading. However, its capabilities are limited in that the user would be unable to obtain a deep understanding of the text.

                    Metadata, as defined by <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/metadata">techtarget</a>, is data that summarizes basic information about objects. For example, a digital image can contain metadata that lists its name, date taken, and the camera that was used to capture it.
                  </p>
                  <p class="log-content-para">
                    In the digital world, a metadata vocabulary defines a set of control terms we use to organize such information about objects. An example of one such vocabulary is the <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)</a>. DCMI's specifications provide guidelines for embedding organized, consistent and well-formatted data in digital objects. Thus, it is one of the most popular metadata vocabularies that are in use today.

                  <p class="log-content-para">
                    As stated by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/">W3</a>, validation, conversion, display, and search of tabular data on the web requires metadata that describes how the data should be interpreted. A consistent vocabulary is necessary for computers to read, interpret, and filter digital objects. Metadata is important to humans because it allows for easier archiving. Metadata also allows authors'/creators' work to be discovered effortlessly.

                    The term "attention economy" refers to a component of information economics in which human attention is treated as a resource. As alternatively <a href="http://readwrite.com/2007/08/25/attention_economy_primer">defined by Richard Macmanus (2007)</a>, the attention economy is a marketplace where consumers agree toreceive services in exchange for their attention.
                  </p>
                  <p class="log-content-para">
                    We can see activity based on this idea across the web. News feeds in <em>Facebook</em>, for example, illustrate it well. <em>Facebook</em>, in exchange for our attention towards their News Feed page, delivers advertising from other businesses in the side bar. Even during my research for this log, I encountered an advertisement for the <em>2016 Honda Pilot</em> when reading <em>readwrite.com</em>. The attention economy is socially relevant to us because <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/08/12/attention-economy/">large sums of money are exchanged</a> for advertisements, which are then exchanged for our attention. The attention of media consumers plays a crucial role in business and, in turn, the economy.

Firstly, all text that must be read have contrasting backgrounds. The text in the header are white with a dark background. The large title casts a shadow for greater readability. The body text is readable as they are displayed on white. The website also addresses the principle that font sizes should be large enough to be readable on standard displays. The site can be easily scanned with mobile devices, laptops, and large displays. In addition to respecting the above principles, the labels in my sidebar specify sections using key words. Overall, following these principles have allowed the site to be readable to most users.

                    The focus of this log will be on "How does testing work?" under Paul Ford's "What is code?". Testing is essential for ensuring that a product, technology, or idea can function according to specification. I believe testing in computer programming heavily intersects with other practices in our cultures. In the automobile industry, we constantly test cars to determine if they can keep passengers safe in a collision. In architecture, we test buildings to determine their compatibility with the environment. In software engineering, we write and run tests to ensure that bugs are absent in the code and that it works as expected. The concept of testing has been in practice for centuries, and it has clearly been inherited by new media and the digital world.

                    Alan Turing was a renowned mathematician, wartime code-breaker, inventor, and a man ahead of his time. His work form cornerstones of the digital age, and have earned him recognition as one of the fathers of computer science. In his time, Turing developed a concept that would shape our modern world: the Turing Machine. This was an idea for a machine that could be programmed, or instructed, to perform different tasks. The Turing Machine is considered as the basis of the modern theory of computation. However, it is more commonly known as the computer. A few years prior to WWII, Turing began to work for the British government's cryptography analysis department. Here, he played the crucial role of decrypting the messages from Enigma (a sophisticated German encryption machine) with his own device known as Colossus. This provided a wealth of information to the Allies, and was assessed to have shortened the war by two years.
