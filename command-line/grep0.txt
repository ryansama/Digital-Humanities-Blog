                    The term "attention economy" refers to a component of information economics in which human attention is treated as a resource. As alternatively <a href="http://readwrite.com/2007/08/25/attention_economy_primer">defined by Richard Macmanus (2007)</a>, the attention economy is a marketplace where consumers agree toreceive services in exchange for their attention.

                    We can see activity based on this idea across the web. News feeds in <em>Facebook</em>, for example, illustrate it well. <em>Facebook</em>, in exchange for our attention towards their News Feed page, delivers advertising from other businesses in the side bar. Even during my research for this log, I encountered an advertisement for the <em>2016 Honda Pilot</em> when reading <em>readwrite.com</em>. The attention economy is socially relevant to us because <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/08/12/attention-economy/">large sums of money are exchanged</a> for advertisements, which are then exchanged for our attention. The attention of media consumers plays a crucial role in business and, in turn, the economy.
