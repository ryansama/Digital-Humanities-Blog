Log 1: Alan Turing

Alan Turing was a renowned mathematician, wartime code-breaker, inventor, and a man ahead of his time. His work form cornerstones of the digital age, and have earned him recognition as one of the fathers of computer science. In his time, Turing developed a concept that would shape our modern world: the Turing Machine. This was an idea for a machine that could be programmed, or instructed, to perform different tasks. The Turing Machine is considered as the basis of the modern theory of computation. However, it is more commonly known as the computer. A few years prior to WWII, Turing began to work for the British government's cryptography analysis department. Here, he played the crucial role of decrypting the messages from Enigma (a sophisticated German encryption machine) with his own device known as Colossus. This provided a wealth of information to the Allies, and was assessed to have shortened the war by two years.

Log 2: Code testing

The focus of this log will be on "How does testing work?" under Paul Ford's "What is code?". Testing is essential for ensuring that a product, technology, or idea can function according to specification. I believe testing in computer programming heavily intersects with other practices in our cultures. In the automobile industry, we constantly test cars to determine if they can keep passengers safe in a collision. In architecture, we test buildings to determine their compatibility with the environment. In software engineering, we write and run tests to ensure that bugs are absent in the code and that it works as expected. The concept of testing has been in practice for centuries, and it has clearly been inherited by new media and the digital world.

Log 3: Readability

The styles used in my website respect several principles of readability. Firstly, all text that must be read have contrasting backgrounds. The text in the header are white with a dark background. The large title casts a shadow for greater readability. The body text is readable as they are displayed on white. The website also addresses the principle that font sizes should be large enough to be readable on standard displays. The site can be easily scanned with mobile devices, laptops, and large displays. In addition to respecting the above principles, the labels in my sidebar specify sections using key words. Overall, following these principles have allowed the site to be readable to most users.

Log 4: The Attention Economy

The term "attention economy" refers to a component of information economics in which human attention is treated as a resource. As alternatively defined by Richard Macmanus (2007), the attention economy is a marketplace where consumers agree to receive services in exchange for their attention.

We can see activity based on this idea across the web. News feeds in Facebook, for example, illustrate it well. Facebook, in exchange for our attention towards their News Feed page, delivers advertising from other businesses in the side bar. Even during my research for this log, I encountered an advertisement for the 2016 Honda Pilot when reading readwrite.com. The attention economy is socially relevant to us because large sums of money are exchanged for advertisements, which are then exchanged for our attention. The attention of media consumers plays a crucial role in business and, in turn, the economy.

Log 5: Metadata

Metadata, as defined by http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/metadata, is information that summarizes basic information about data or objects. For example, a digital image can contain metadata that lists its name, date taken, and the camera that was used to capture it.

In the digital world, a metadata vocabulary defines a set of control terms we use to organize such information about objects. An example of one such vocabulary is the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI). DCMI's specifications provide guidelines for embedding organized, consistent and well-formatted data in digital objects. Thus, it is one of the most popular metadata vocabularies that are in use today.

As stated by W3, http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/, validation, conversion, display, and search of tabular data on the web requires metadata that describes how the data should be interpreted. A consistent vocabulary is necessary for computers to read, interpret, and filter digital objects. Metadata is important to humans because it allows for easier archiving. Metadata also allows authors'/creators' work to be discovered effortlessly.
